# D-racula-WM
Dracula DWM rice

Hello! This is my rice of DWM with the dracula colour scheme.

Most of Dotfiles are forked from DistroTubes repo and customised. (https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles) I'm a big fan and you should check out his channel on youtube.

To install simply:

1. cd into your .config directory
2. git clone this repo
3. And finally "sudo make install" in the directories "st", "dwm" and "dmenu".

There is a script included that should set up the bar, launch the compositor and set the wallpaper (using xwallpaper).
I have my wallpaper location as ~/Pictures/arch.jpg so either copy that or edit the script to your preference. The wallpaper I use is included.

The font that is used is JetBrains mono and is available in the AUR.
